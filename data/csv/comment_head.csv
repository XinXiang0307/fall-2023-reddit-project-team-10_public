tjzad4,ejpintar,"Yeah I mean we really don’t have much to say about subjective matters at all. If we’re saying Fe and Fi are responsible for subjective judgements, well all we have in that department is inferior Fe. I find that I often don’t know how to answer questions like “what do you want to do” or “how does this make you feel”, since I don’t really know how to generate my own subjective judgments much of the time. I either try to figure out an objective answer rationally with Ti, or just say what I’ve heard other people say with Fe. So I can see how that can be frustrating to a high Fi-user like an ENFP. My perspective is kind of just “subjective judgements are just a matter of personal feeling, so there’s no real way to discuss them with someone else or evaluate them.”

As I mentioned in the original comment, I kind of have the same experience with regards to objective questions. I’ve found that when I’m having a presumably rational discussion with an Fi/Te user, they often just appeal to whatever some authority says about it. I’ll be like “what do *you* think the answer is?” and they will say “well according to this website I read, the answer is…” Or they say “it’s just subjective” even when it isn’t. You can imagine how that’s frustrating.",t3_tjzad4,6,0,t1,2022,3
tjzad4,9741804,"I do know, yeah. Understanding things and actually encountering things in real time is very different. I know there's downsides to what I am. I see it every day when people expect me to TE like a pro bc I'm a guy. And I know people like you, who might feel like aliens with the way people treat you. This mbti stuff is really about having empathy and learning that different people are not defective because of it, and trying to understand the bullshit that is life. You keep becoming the best you you can be 👍",t3_tjzad4,3,0,t1,2022,3

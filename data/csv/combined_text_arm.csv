0,"I think you may be an ENFP Ne: dominant function; Fi: Auxiliary function; Te: 3rd function; Si: weak function; It is because you scored low on consciousness so you are out of the xxxJ and high on openness and agreeableness then you are probably xNFP and since you got 65% Extroversion then it should be ENFP You could use this site to test your personality type again. it was more accurate for me than most other websites.

5,"Because we're pretty open minded despite appearances. We consider lots of possibilities/opinions thanks to dom Ni and aux Fe before coming to a conclusion and rather like to entertain and understand different points of view even if we don't agree with them. It's one of those classic INFJ contradictions everyone loves so, so much that make us super easy to read and understand.",INFJ

7,"My part of our bedroom- Colorful and relatively clean, but not obsessively so. Things are where they logically make sense to be accessed. I never make my side of the bed, but otherwise pretty decent. (My car is a different storyâ€¦ big olâ€™ yikes) My ENFP wifeâ€™s space in our room- letâ€™s see how much stuff we can shove in one corner. But otherwise, sheâ€™s pretty clean. Leaves wine glasses and coffee mugs everywhere with like 1cm worth of liquid left, though. ðŸ˜–  My estj sonâ€™s (4)- flawlessly clean and heâ€™s not even five yet. What the hell. Te doms amaze me. ENTP daughterâ€™s (8) room - have you seen Hoarders? That.","ENFP, ESTJ, ENTP"
